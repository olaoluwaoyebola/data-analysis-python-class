# Python for Data Analysis \& Visualization 🐍 📊





## 📖 About This Curriculum

This repository contains a comprehensive, 6-week intensive curriculum designed to teach Python programming from scratch with a specific focus on **Data Analysis** and **Visualization**.



The course takes learners from writing their first variable to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets using industry-standard libraries like **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,** and **Seaborn.**



## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Write Python code confidently
* Manipulate and analyze datasets
* Clean and preprocess real-world data
* Build visualizations with Matplotlib \& Seaborn
* Use Pandas and NumPy effectively
* Apply analytics thinking to solve problems





## 🧠 Who this is for

*  Beginners
*  Data analysis students
*  Self-learners
*  Tutors/teachers
*  Anyone transitioning into Data Analytics





## 📂 Repository Structure



The curriculum is organized into modular folders. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for lessons and weekly assignments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you need Python 3.x installed. We highly recommend installing Anaconda, which includes Python, Jupyter, and all necessary data science libraries.





Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-data-analysis.git





Navigate to the directory:

Bash

cd data-analysis-python-class





Install Dependencies (if not using Anaconda):

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt





Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook









## 🧪 Assignments \& Capstone

Weekly Assignments: Located at the end of every module folder (e.g., week1\_assignment.ipynb). These challenge you to apply what you learned in that week's lessons.



Final Capstone: A guided project located in 06\_Final\_Project/. You will choose a dataset and perform a complete analysis to answer specific business questions.



## 🤝 Contributing
