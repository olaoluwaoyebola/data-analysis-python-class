# Python for Data Analysis \& Visualization 🐍 📊





### 📖 About This Curriculum

This repository contains a comprehensive, 6-week intensive curriculum designed to teach Python programming from scratch with a specific focus on \*\*Data Analysis\*\* and \*\*Visualization\*\*.



The course takes learners from writing their first variable to performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on real-world datasets using industry-standard libraries like \*\*Pandas\*\*, \*\*Numpy\*\*, \*\*Matplotlib\*\*, and \*\*Seaborn\*\*.



#### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

* Write Python code confidently
* Manipulate and analyze datasets
* Clean and preprocess real-world data
* Build visualizations with Matplotlib \& Seaborn
* Use Pandas and NumPy effectively
* Apply analytics thinking to solve problems





##### 🧠 Who this is for

*  Beginners
*  Data analysis students
*  Self-learners
*  Tutors/teachers
*  Anyone transitioning into Data Analytics





##### 📂 Repository Structure



The curriculum is organized into modular folders. Each folder contains Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) for lessons and weekly assignments.

##### 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites

To run these notebooks, you need Python 3.x installed. We highly recommend installing Anaconda, which includes Python, Jupyter, and all necessary data science libraries.





Clone the repository:



Bash



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-data-analysis.git





Navigate to the directory:



Bash



cd Python-Data-Analysis-Curriculum





Install Dependencies (if not using Anaconda):



Bash



pip install -r requirements.txt





Launch Jupyter Notebook:



Bash



jupyter notebook





##### 🧪 Assignments \& Capstone

Weekly Assignments: Located at the end of every module folder (e.g., week1\_assignment.ipynb). These challenge you to apply what you learned in that week's lessons.



Final Capstone: A guided project located in 06\_Final\_Project/. You will choose a dataset and perform a complete analysis to answer specific business questions.
